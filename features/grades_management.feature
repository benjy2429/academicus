Feature: Grades Mangement
  As a user
  I want to add, edit and remove qualifications, years, subjects and assessments
  So I can manage the assessments and grades I achieve

Scenario: View qualifications
  Given I am on the Reminders page
  When I touch "Grades"
  Then I should see "Qualifications"
